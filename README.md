movie_name='Toy Story' movie_rate='9.5' movie_review="This is classic Pixar movie about toys that talk. It's hard not to love the classic character of Woody Cowboy, a Sheriff toy with a pull string that speaks in a twangy drawl. This film is like a daydream come true, what if toys were aloud talk when no human was around?"
